&lt;p>Low-light video enhancement is a challenging task with broad applications. However, current research in this area is limited by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets. To address this issue, we design a camera system and collect a high-quality low-light video dataset with multiple exposures and cameras. Our dataset provides dynamic video pairs with pronounced camera motion and strict spatial alignment. To achieve general low-light video enhancement, we also propose a novel Retinex-based method named Light Adjustable Network (LAN). LAN iteratively refines the illumination and adaptively adjusts it under varying lighting conditions, leading to visually appealing results even in diverse real-world scenarios. The extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our low-light video dataset and enhancement method. Our dataset is available at &lt;a href="https://github.com/ciki000/DID">https://github.com/ciki000/DID&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
